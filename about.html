                Hi! My name is Sharmin Zaman and I am a 2nd year student studying Mechatronic Engineering 
                and Computer Science at the University of New South Wales! My hobbies include writing, 
                binging TEDx talks to feel like I've gained a braincell and making a beeline for every
                fried chicken place there is in Sydney.
