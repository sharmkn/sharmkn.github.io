            <h3>This website!</h3>
            <p1>
                I'm doing this website from scratch, and I'm insanely aware of its shortcomings. I have a real limited knowledge of HTML 
                but we all have to start somewhere, right? Hence why I'm not too fussed, rather, it'll be my way to crash, burn, and
                somewhat learn, HTML/CSS.

            <h3>Web Scraper</h3>
            <p1>
                Still in its very early stages, but essentially given the link to a product, this program intends to check its price on 
                an hourly basis and email the user if the price has changed. Also trying to use this to find whether GA tickets are being
                sold on Ticketek Marketplace for The 1975 in Sydney. I still regret not buying those tickets each and everyday, but it's 
                what inspired me to make this application, so at least something good came out of it, right?

            <h3>Link Up (coming soon!)</h3>
            <p1>
                Intends to remove the hassle of finding a place and time to meet up with your very large and very uncommunicative friends.
                (Because getting new friends is 100% not an option.)
