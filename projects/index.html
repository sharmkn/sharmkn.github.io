            I'm doing this website from scratch, and I'm insanely aware of its shortcomings. I have a real limited knowledge of HTML
            but we all have to start somewhere, right? Hence why I'm not too fussed, rather, it'll be my way to crash, burn,
            and somewhat learn, HTML/CSS.

            Still in its very early stages, but essentially given the link to a product, this program intends to check its price on an
            hourly basis and email the user if the price has changed. Also trying to use this to find whether GA tickets
            are being sold on Ticketek Marketplace for The 1975 in Sydney. I still regret not buying those tickets each and
            everyday, but it's what inspired me to make this application, so at least something good came out of it, right?

            This baby is on her way, but she intends to remove the hassle of finding a place and time to meet up with your very large
            and very uncommunicative group of friends. (Because getting new friends is 100% not an option.)
